# WIFIBOT-AUTONOMOUS-ROBOT
In this project, we are developing a WIFI Bot autonomous robot for object detection, tracking, and autonomous driving using YOLOv3 and Deep SORT algorithms. A Raspberry Pi is utilized as the central processing unit, enabling efficient execution of the algorithms and seamless communication with the robot's hardware components.
